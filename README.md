# Embedded System Development without IDE

We are losing control on our code on embedded system development with some modern fancy IDEs like KEIL, Eclipse, IAR...

It's may not a big deal if you are only focusing on development itself, and it actually would increase developing efficiency especially for beginners. But over-reliance on IDE would prevent you from learning deeper knowledge of coding, so if you are an enthusiastic learner like me, you may like this project.

Indeed, I won't reinvent the wheel like some device driver. I'll use the most popular and reliable library CMSIS for this project.

I plan to write a RTOS-based project, but I haven't decided the main function of this project yet. It's just a led-blinker for now.
